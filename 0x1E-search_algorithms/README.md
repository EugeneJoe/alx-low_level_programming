# Search Algorithms

Searching Algorithms are used to determine whether a specific piece of data exists within
a data structure. If it does exist, a search algorithm will locate it and retrieve the information.
Search algorithms are compared based on:
1. Time complexity i.e how long an algorithm takes to perform a search
2. Space complexity i.e how much space an algorithm utilizes when performing a search

Search algorithms are classified based on their searching mechanism into 3 types of algorithms:
1. Linear
2. Binary
3. Hashing

The files in this directory demonstrate implementations of various search algorithms
as well as their performance metrics in terms of space complexity and time complexity.
