# Introduction

This folder contains C program files that demonstrate working with variables and
controlling program flow through if, else and while statements.

## 0-positive_or_negative.c

Generates a random number and determines whether it is positive or negative
and prints that to the screen.

## 1-last_digit.c

A C program that assigns a random number to a variable n and prints output as
follows:

1. The string "Last digit of"
2. 'n', followed by
3. the string "is", followed by
   - if the last digit of 'n' is greater than 5:
     - "n and is greater than 5"
   -if the last digit of 'n' is 0:
     - "n and is 0"
   - if the last digit of 'n' is less than 6:
     - "n and is less than 6 and not 0"
4. followed by a new line

## 2-print_alphabet.c

A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

## 3-print_alphabets.c

A c program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase,
followed by a new line.

## 4-print_alphabt.c

A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except characters 'q' and 'e'
, followed by a new line.

## 5-print_numbers.c

A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0,
followed by a new line.

## 6-print_numberz.c

A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0,
followed by a new line. This version uses the "putchar" command and prints
the digits using their ASCII equivalents.

## 7-print_tebahpla.c

A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new
line.

## 8-print_base16.c

A C program that prints all the numbers of base16 in lowecase, followed by a new
line.

## 9-print_comb.c

A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers in
ascending order.

## 10-print_comb2.c

A C program that prints numbers from 00 - 99, in ascending order.

## 11-print_comb3.c

A C program that prints all possible unique combinations of two digits, in
ascending order. The two digits must be different i.e 01 and 10 are considered
the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1.

## 101-print_comb4.c

A C program that prints all possible unique combinations of three digits, in
ascending order. The three digits must be different i.e 012, 120, 102, 021, 201,
210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2.
Only the smallest combination of three digits is printed.

## 102-print_comb5.c

A C program that prints all possible unique combinations of two two-digit
numbers. All numbers are printed with two digits i.e. 1 is printed as 01.
Both numbers are printed in ascending order. 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as
the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1.
