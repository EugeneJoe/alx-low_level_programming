# Doubly Linked Lists

The files in this directory demonstrate how to use doubly linked lists and show
the various operations that can be carried out on them.

## 0-print_dlistint.c

Prints all the elements of a dlistint_t doubly linked list.
Takes a pointer to the head node of the linked list.

## 1-dlistint_len.c

Returns the number of elements/nodes in a dlistint_t doubly linked list.
Takes a pointer to the head node of the linked list.

## 2-add_dnodeint.c

Adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t doubly linked list.
Takes a pointer to the head node of the linked list as well as an
integer variable to initialize the new node with.

## 3-add_dnodeint_end.c

Adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t doubly linked list.
Takes a pointer to the head node of the linked list as well as an
integer variable to initialize the new node with.

## 4-free_dlistint.c

Frees a dlistint_t doubly linked list. Takes a pointer to the head node
of the linked list.

## 5-get_dnodeint.c

Returns the pointer to the nth node of a dlistint_t doubly linked list.
Takes a pointer to the head node of the doubly linked list, as well as an
integer that is the index of the required node.

## 6-sum_dlistint.c

Returns the sum of all the data in a dlistint_t doubly linked list.
Takes a pointer to the head node of the linked list.

## 7-insert_dnodeint.c

Inserts a new node at a given position in a dlistint_t doubly linked list.
Takes a double pointer to the head node of the linked list, as well as an index
value specifying where to insert the new node and an integer variable to
initialize the new node with.

## 8-delete_dnodeint.c

Deletes a node at a specific index of a dlistint_t doubly linked list.
Takes a double pointer to the head node of the linked list, as well as the
index value of the node to be deleted.

## 102-result

Largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
